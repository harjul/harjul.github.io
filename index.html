<h1> Audit & Governance on Oracle Cloud</h1>
<p> Concept of Audit Log is quite simple. As per the Wikipedia, An audit trail (audit log) is a security-relevant chronological record, set of records, and/or destination and source of records that provide documentary evidence of the sequence of activities that have affected at any time a specific operation, procedure, or event.</p>
<p> <b> Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Audit service </b> automatically records calls to all supported Oracle Cloud Infrastructure public application programming interface (API) endpoints as log events. Log events recorded by the Audit service include API calls made by the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console, Command Line Interface (CLI), Software Development Kits (SDK), your own custom clients, or other Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services.</p>
